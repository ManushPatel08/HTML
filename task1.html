        <p>
            - C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1971 1972.
            <br>
            - It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.

    <font color="white" size="4"><h2>Advantages:</h2></font>
    <font color="yellow" size="5">
            <p> -> C is a fast and reliable language that can write efficient code. 
                <br>
                -> C is extendable and has built-in functions and operators.
                <br> 
                -> C is more efficient than C++ because it doesn't require Virtual Method Table (VMT) lookups. </p>
    </font>
    <font color="white" size="4"><h2>Disadvantages:</h2></font>
    <font color="yellow" size="5">
        <p>
            -> C does not support exception handling.
            <br>
            -> It does not have strict type checking.
            <br>
            -> Most importantly, C does not support OOPs.
